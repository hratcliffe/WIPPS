SDF stuff exists in Fortran, C, Python, IDL
No writing yet

C or Fortran can be paralleised easily. Can also trivially parallise in space blocks

Inputs:
wave spectrum E and/ or B Lets use SDF format for the experience eh?
In which case, might almost as well rewrite the stuff to process. 
Fast fft in C?

Frequency axis
What do we do with wavenumber? Our spectra can just be interpolated onto a freq axis.

plasma parameters, probably from file

Angular range, energy range etc etc for output

-------------------------------------------------------------

Use Albert (2005) equations, numbers given

Whatever we do, probably make/find integrator routine which takes integrand and axis/d x, possibly jacobian for angles etc?

Need to calc ERF for Gaussians (is in math.h?)
Sin and cos also in math.h
Derivatives

FFTW

Array type with an indexing function

class array{


}

Maybe data type class of 1-d array, sizes, index fns and axes?

-------------------------------------------------------------


Read E and/or B

FFT on subdivisions in space, time range
Make powers of 2, 3, 5 for speed

extract spectra, and angular dependence thereof

calc refractive index as fn of space, angle

Calc D
  

Integrate in wave freq, and in tan of wave angle

Do bounce averaging

ToDo

3-D arrays

Work out SDF read etc

File output/save

FFTs

Integrator

Document!! w. Doxygen


Grep for TODO and NB for notes etc
