Whatare dndth, dndr etc etc from mufunctions?

Are the s2psi, c2psi the sin^2, cos^2 respectively?

We start with this:
[|ooooo||ooooo||ooooo|][|ooooo||ooooo||ooooo|]
and add new space for 2 more “rows”
[|ooooo||ooooo||ooooo|][|ooooo||ooooo||ooooo|][0000000000]
now we shunt that last row to the right
[|ooooo||ooooo||ooooo|][|ooooo||ooooo|[xxxxx]|ooooo|][00000]
and the next two
[|ooooo||ooooo||ooooo|][xxxxx][|ooooo||ooooo||ooooo|][00000]
and now just null out the duplicated bit with the x’s

o is data els. 0 new null data els, x ‘dead’ copies of els
